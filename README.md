# Compression_MPI
This repository is to store two versions of the same library that I designed during my PhD for compressing at run-time MPI messages using different compression algorithms. The compression is adaptive, so it turns on and off dependeding on the: data size of the message, network speed, data type of the message.

The first version is called PRACTICAL 3.0 (PRAcTICaL-MPI (Portable Adaptive Compression Library- MPI) explained at the Euro-Par 2012 conference in the work published as "An Adaptive, Scalable, and Portable Technique for Speeding Up MPI-Based Applications".
